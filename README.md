# CROWDFUNDING

``` 
Student Crowdfunding 
There are a lot of students in KJSCE who make several projects/products which interest
a lot of people in the market. However, these students do not have enough money to take
their product to the market. Also, there are a lot of investors across the world who are
ready to invest in such ventures but are unaware of such exciting products.
Make a crowdfunding platform for the students of KJSCE to help them raise funds by getting
donations, orders etc. so that they can bring their product to the market.
